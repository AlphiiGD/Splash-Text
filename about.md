# Creating Custom Splashes
To create custom splashes, create a file somewhere and give it
the file extension `.splash`, `.txt`, or `.text`. Making a splash
is as simple as just writing one per line. However, there are some
additional features documented in the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AlphiiGD/Splash-Text).
